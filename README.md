 “Requirement Analysis in Software Development.”

 The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

“What is Requirement Analysis?”
Requirement analysis is the critical first step in software development, where the needs and expectations of users and stakeholders are identified, documented, and clarified. It's a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it ensures that the software being built aligns with what users actually need and want, ultimately leading to a more successful and efficient development process. 
Importance in SDLC:
Foundation for Development
Reduces Development Risks
Improves Communication
Ensures User Satisfaction
Facilitates Accurate Estimation
Enables Effective Testing
Manages Change Effectively
